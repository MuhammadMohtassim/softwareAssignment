# Summary: 
GDPR (European Unoin General Data Protection Regulation). 
CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and other international regulation on privacy may affect researchers dealing with personal data.Even if the is public.Even if it was uploaded by individuals themselves, with perfect knowledge about what they were doing.
Even if the researchers is in a different country of those enacting the regulation.


				
#				An Empirical Study of  Method Chaining in Java.
# Auther:
	Tomoki Nakamaru, Tomomasa Matsunaga, Tetsura Yamazaki, Soramichi Akiyama, Shigeru Chiba.

# Summary:
While some promote method chaining as s good practice for improving code readability,
others refer to it as a bad practice that worsens code quality.
We than explore language features that are helpful to the method chaining style but have not
been supported yet in Java.We also estimated how effective they are to encourage the 
method chaining style if they are adopted in Java.


#					 JTeC.(A Large collection of Java Test Classes for Test Code Analysis and Processing)

# Auther:
	Federico Coro, Roberto Verdecchia, emilio Cruciani, Breno Miranda, Antonia Bertolino.

# Summary: 
We present JTeC, a Large-scale dataset of test cases that researchers can use for benchmarking the above technique or any other type of tool expressly targeting test code.
JTeC collects more than 2.5M test classes belonging to more than 430 Millions 
SLOCs of ready-to-use-real-world test code.
